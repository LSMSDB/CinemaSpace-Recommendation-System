	"overview":"Almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon LV-223, the deep-space colonisation vessel Covenant, with more than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation, is on course for the remote planet Origae-6 with the intention to build a new world. Instead, a rogue transmission entices the crew to a nearby habitable planet which resembles Earth. The unsuspecting crewmembers of the Covenant will have to cope with biological foes beyond human comprehension. Ultimately, what was intended as a peaceful exploratory mission, will soon turn into a desperate rescue operation in uncharted space.",
